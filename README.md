# 2 Wheeled Traveler

Vintage motorcyclists have come to rely on cell phones more and more while riding their motorcycles. This app eliminates the need for multiple apps by combining features like speed, weather, and gas onto a single screen that overlays your standard mapping program.

## Getting started

- In order to start developing we are using expo to run our application during development. Follow the steps to install on the expo guide. 
- Our application is developed off the back of React Native and so to start development, follow the steps to install React-Native.
- We use npm to build our application and include all of our packages that we use so during installation of React-Native and Node.js make sure to include Node Packet Manager as well.
- After gaining access to our repository, to start development run `npm install` to install all packages necessary to run our application.
- When ready to run a local server, run `npm start` this should run a script to automatically start expo. This can be verified by checking the `package.json` file.
- This start guide was written on 11/15/2019 and verified by Eric K Zhu(ekzhu703@gmail.com) on Windows 10; email me with any questions.

## Testing

For testing, we created unit tests and generated coverage reports using Jest.
- First,  Jest needs to be installed for Expo
`npm i jest-expo --save-dev`
- To run the tests, run
`npm test`

To view the coverage report, open the `index.html` file within the `/coverage/` directory. 

## Deployment

- Our production code is hosted on GitHub in the 2WheeledTraveler repository master branch. A new developer can view the code as it is public but must first get permission from administrator Eric Zhu (ekzhu703@gmail.com) to contribute changes.
- Our fully deployed application will be hosted on the application stores, aka App Store and Google Play for iOS and Android.
- At this point in time, continuous deployment is not enabled.

## Technologies used

- We are using Google Firebase's database to manage users and their data
- Our navigation is provided by Google Maps
- Our application is built off of the React Native infrastructure

## Contributing

- Before contributing to the application, a new contributor must first request access from current admin Eric Zhu (ericzhu@live.unc.edu). Additionally Anna Truelove handles Trello board management. Furthermore, a new developer must be added to obtain access to our firebase database
- Our team follows development best practices and should inquire with the current development team about team best practices.
